# JailbreakData
A script that scrapes /r/jailbreak and records the fate of comments and submissions

It should work in such a way that it would work for any subreddit with similar moderator practices as /r/jailbreak (i.e. having a strict format for telling people why their stuff was removed), but I haven't tested it and can't vouch for it.

The data was collected from 3/30/2018 to 4/17/2018. I wanted to collect for a whole month but my raspberry pi goofed and stopped some scripts I was running, including this one.

Have fun with the data!
