Do you like the idea of a paid hierarchy where people who are willing to say pay 5$ will get a premium membership and somebody who pays 2$ gets a basic membership. This would be somewhat like packix where you can be a patreon or buy the tweaks one-by-one. We at Auxilium Development have been thinking of something like this where we will still release free tweaks but have options for people to buy licenses for paid tweaks that we release in the future. How do you guys feel? Please reply and keep it civil. This isn't a definite plan but I just want to know how you guys feel about it!",

I understand it's the easiest platform to reach this community but why does the frontpage have to be flooded with drama everytime?\n\nthe developers behind Packix are extremely talented people and you cannot deny that. Coming from a developers perspective bugs are the death of us. We don't like having to think we have a working tweak just to find out 1/2 the people wanting to can't use it. However... dpn't have a bug report section and an issue section and not check it and reply? From what I've seen on reddit before Quoll became Bug Report manager, people weren't getting anywhere with the Bug Report section.\n\nDid you not see this is a red flag? You're gonna pay monthly or purchase tweaks from a team without good CRM? I don't know that seems sketchy.\n\nSince we have started pushing out tweaks we have tried to answer everybody with problems. CRM is the number one factor when it comes to being successful in a consumer market. I understand you want to make money of your work and the work is great you deserve it! I'm not gonna start bitching about patreon but we all know that it is not the way to go. \n\nAs for the repeated posts (sorry im contributing) we don't need anymore. We have seen many, many, many threads about people complainging about Packix. I think most people on this Sub know that packix has a problem. As for myself I wouldn't ever pay for a tweak where hundreds of people are complaining. Yet people still do and then continue to complain about it. It's getting to be to much.\n\nThis is just my 2 cents I'm prepared for the many downvotes to come.",

Reason being it was only for devs. I left it on my phone but deleted it as soon as Electra b1 jailbreak came out. I never had any problems with Electra even after it updated to add cydia. I used Electra v1 to give me cydia and I did something... I\u2019m not sure what :/ but cydia disappeared off my home screen! I tried downloading the new Electra again to try to redownload it but got the error topanga. And when I use the old Electra it successfully jailbreaks my phone but no matter what I cannot ssh into it.

I've heard about FutureRestore allowing a drop down to 11.1.2 after upgrading to 11.2.6 (considering it's still being signed - window is getting smaller since 11.3 was released). I don't want to possibly lose a potential (untethered) jailbreak by being hasty. But if there's a genuine chance I can be jailbroken today versus a few months down the line, I'll take the former.

Then I wiped the phone through iCloud and i just wanted to share my experience. \n\nIt\u2019s fast! Like really silky smooth. Now i partially understand what Saurik meant when saying he\u2019s got a better solution. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Coolstar\u2019s jailbreak and tweaks but this was the case with my iPhone at least and i\u2019m a experienced jailbreaker so i know kinda what i\u2019m doing. \n\nIf you are considering restoring to 11.2+ just because the phone feels slow etc, then don\u2019t. Just clean it and wait for Saurik.",

  "content": "Coolstar has just said in twitter (after the coordinated developer quitting action) that there is 1 single account on reddit, an obvious troll, that is stirring up all this drama. \n\nThat person is me. Coolstar believes I am the cause for all the drama on reddit, and I am the reason why he is leaving. \n\nHe wants the mods to ban me, which in my opinion essentially means: \u2018do as I say or I quit and the mods are to blame\u2019. \n\nCoolstar, I\u2019d very much like to have a public conversation here with you. You see, I disagree that I am a troll. I actually believe my posts & comments (I deleted the posts about you & nullpixel, but I\u2019m sure someone has a backup, feel free to post it.) are fair, and actually talk about things that are an obvious issue in this community. \n\nMy posts regarding your and nullpixel\u2019s drama received over 800 karma, so that seems to indicate a large percentage of people on here agreed with my points. (As 800+ karma is a lot these days.) \n\nYou said some of my points were made up, I\u2019d be happy to have you publicly tell me which points that are and where I am incorrect. Just know, if I used the [Discussion] tag it is obviously an opinion rather than stating facts.\n\nMy post about Andy was again supported by almost every single person in that thread. No one except for LQ and Fr0st (obviously as they have a business relationship with Andy) disagreed. \n\nMy post again, well over 420 karma, Andy\u2019s horrible damage control -1 karma. Why is that? Is that because my points (except for the 7th point) were valid and users simply agreed with me?\n\nLets not forget that you and Nullpixel were calling out Andy for stealing electra publicly, and now you are defending him?.\n\nAs I said in an other post, me and others might put fuel on the fire (because I believe the community had the right to know what is going on and what the important people in this community are up to.) but the fire was already there to begin with, caused by you, nullpixel, Andy and recently LQ. \n\nNullpixel then made a thread basically asking the mods to moderate this sub in a way where all critique is silenced, killing free speech and giving you 2 power you should not have. \n\n\nIt\u2019s very obvious that when it was clear the mods weren\u2019t going to basically change this sub to one controlled by you 2 you started bashing the mods continually and are now *very likely* about to announce the forum you guys are talking about on Twitter. A forum ran by you all so you can silence critique (in the name of preventing toxicity). This would also give you the ability to silence competitors (not saying you will, but your history definitely suggests this is something you might consider) and since there is no rating / karma system like reddit, no one would really be able to understand what others in the community agree to.\n\nReddit is perfect in this sense. As long as you are civil you can share your opinion. Even if that opinion is one not shared by you. I\u2019m actually surprised about how well r/jb is currently being moderated especially when it comes to conflict in interest. \n\nYes, I am not a fan of you and Nullpixel. Both of you have a incredible history of causing drama and then later playing the victim card, and when you see a lot of people on reddit agreed, you deleted your twitter (and said you would quit for the x\u2019th time). \n\nI am genuinely willing to have an open civil discussion with you, nullpixel, andy, LQ, or anyone else who feels I am the single cause of all this drama (this idea is laughable in my opinion. One singular reddit account cannot cause so much drama. \n\nThe fact that you still don\u2019t see that most of this drama was caused you all of you, and people like me are simply reporting & sharing their option is completely beyond me. Yes that might increase the drama but the drama was already caused by you and company). \n\nIf you would like to have a civil conversation with instead of just complaining on twitter, I\u2019d be very happy to do that. Publicly so the community can see and make up their own mind on all of this. If I truly were a troll and my intention would be to cause drama I would not do this obviously. ",

I\u2019ve never had to report bugs on a tweak, but I have had products and games go through bugs and instead of giving a report I\u2019ve just shrugged it off and went for something else or just dealt with it. I think it\u2019s a mentality a lot of people have, but clearly some are more vocal to lash out about it, and that won\u2019t change. All devs can do is instead of being condescending jerks about it, just post a link to a place to report bugs anytime a post like that comes up. We don\u2019t need the flavor of text \u201clearn to read\u201d and \u201coh god forbid I\u2019m busy.\u201d Just drop the information needed and that\u2019s it.\n\n>Think of it this way, how would you feel if people said your tweak, your hard work, was a buggy mess but didn\u2019t tell you what those bugs were. It would be like being told to go to a specific place but not given a map on how to get there. We want our tweaks to be as bug free as possible but that can only happen when users, you guys, tell us what the actual issue is.\n\nI have never made a tweak, but again I understand this. If anyone here as worked in nearly any profession where you have to build something, (or had less tech savvy friends or relatives have computer problems), then you know what it\u2019s like to have a customer go \u201cshit is broken!\u201d and when you ask what\u2019s wrong they kind of just go \u201cI dunno it won\u2019t turn on\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s slow\u201d etc. But you know what professionals *don\u2019t* do? Tell the person with a problem to stop being an entitled child, tell them and any customers in earshot you don\u2019t want to put up with them, and then expect them to take the time to tell *you* what\u2019s wrong with something you made. If you want your tweaks to be fixed, maybe don\u2019t insult the people who are having the problems. Since you rely on them for answers as to why something is broken, then don\u2019t treat them like they mean nothing to you and maybe, just maybe, they\u2019ll take the time to give you the information you need to better your product. \n\n>Developers need to act in a professional manner and I personally realise that we haven\u2019t stood up to that expectation. Sometimes getting into heated arguments with our customers, people who have entrusted their money to us in return for a tweak.\n\nAnd you realize this now out of the blue? Didn\u2019t seem to apply when we saw Coolstar being unprofessional, or AndyWiik being overly aggressive, or you calling nearly anyone who disagreed with you a child on here and on Twitter. But now when your plan has been revealed and your mod status is in question and other better respected developers have criticized you, suddenly you want to stand on a podium and be the voice of reason? Something users here have been saying for months, *now* suddenly you want to comment on it.\n\nSorry but as of now I\u2019m not buying this \u201cwe need to change\u201d letter. Far as I know you\u2019re in your chat right now going \u201cwow look at this child not buying my post instantly can you guys believe this? What a toxic user. And look at the downvotes, I hate this sub, totally not worth my time.\u201d\n\n>We discussed about ditching the sub-reddit entirely but I don\u2019t think that is a proper solution, we should be fixing what we have instead of running away. What we want is a place where we can hold civilized discussions and I think reddit is that place.\n\nHonestly I think the best thing certain developers could do right now is leave, for real, and reevaluate the reason they\u2019re actually here. If, like the leak chat implies, the only reason for these tweaks is just to make money then I\u2019d prefer you\u2019d leave and take that attitude with you. Making tweaks solely for any sort of an income is you wasting your talents, and I don\u2019t see many people wanting to support someone who does it for that reason anyway, especially after this. ",

  "content": "This Reddit used to be really useful. But now all I see is drama and hate. I would like to bring up a few points:\n\n1. Devs in the jailbreaking community are NOT going to be as professional as what you would find developing App Store applications. Pretending to leave the community, being anti user when asked to help link Packix to cydia etc. should be expected  given the more informal relationship between users and developers. With that said, developers (and groups) that release buggy tweaks should simply be ignored. If the users refuse to put up with their bullshit, they will either quit or fix their act. \n\n2.  Mods are human. I think they have done a fine job handling everything other than drama, but with that said certain developers are not fit to moderate certain topics. Specifically, laughingquoll is both a developer and a moderator, and that proves to be a conflict of interest when moderators are, by definition, intended to be unbiased. ( Note: I am not questioning why laughing quoll defended himself, that is necessary to clear up confusion.)\n\nThe solution:\n\nThis sub should be for asking and answering questions about jailbreaks, and discussing tweaking related subjects. That should be it. \n\nBut it's also important to discuss who is worth purchasing tweaks from, and who is worth trusting. So put all of that stuff on another sub Reddit. \n\n/r/Jailbreak: \n- tweaks \n-reviews\n-questions\n-troubleshooting \n\n/r/jailbreakingcommunity:\n- developers\n- users \n- other \"drama\" \n\nThis would hopefully make this sub useable again while still alowing discussion of developers and whatnot.",

  "content": "Since we've had quite enough of juvenile fuckery in the past seventy-two hours the LAST thing needed is to indulge yet another divisive agitator. Let this be a forewarning that there's more self-serving nonsense incoming. That is, if certain claims are to be believed which is always subject to scrutiny where this individual is concerned.\n\n\nDue to whatever ridiculous nonsense prevents Twitter links to coolstar, you'll need to take yourselves off to his page in order to inform yourselves. Take a screenshot, or do what you must. Now, perhaps there is a dubious poster here or elsewhere, who has touched coolstar's nerve, perhaps there isn't. But coolstar has been on about this for some time, and it's clearly become personal to him\u2014 an indicator *that it does not*, in fact, *have the least bit of bearing on the greater purpose or health of this subreddit*. It does not concern us, nor is it justification for us to go rabid and start cudgeling each other in the comments and creating endless posts debating the validity of anything which will come in The Great Reveal. \n\n\nIf any one who has more time on their hands cares to link to said Tweets below, and knows how to navigate the ridiculous auto-whatever-the-fuck, be my guest. You'd probably be doing a general service to all by doing so. Perhaps the mods will be so kind as to provide some advanced hint as how exactly the situation has been handled internally to date, prior to having to field wild accusations when they finally surface.\n\n\nAll things considered, it seems it would be prudent that the moderators, and the readership get ahead of the shitstorm. Kit up your raincoats and boots and be aware of what is on the horizon, and defuse the situation well ahead of the seemingly inevitable downpour. \n\n\nGo ahead, have your combat here amongst yourselves if you must, abuse this post if you must\u2014 but as previously stated, is that really necessary? You may be unhappy with the moderation here. Fair enough. But whatever rubbish will be dumped, and the chaos that will follow, isn't the way to go about addressing that frustration. Nothing constructive will come of it.\n\n\nThere are few things to bear in mind, aside from this being the creator of Electra: do your best to separate in your minds a jailbreak which iOS 11 users are rightfully grateful for, and often quite understandably defensive of, from the disagreeable tendencies of the individual concerned and intentions likely motivating him. This isn't the first, (but hopefully it *will* be the last) time coolstar cooked up a gunpowder plot\u2014 a childish retaliation, an ego-driven vindictiveness, has come out this quarter before. Veterans of this sub have repeatedly indicated to all of you, sometimes politely, and sometimes not so politely, that this behaviour is nothing new. None of that needs to be revisited. Point being, you would do well to not be the least bit surprised when it unfolds this time around.\n\n\nThat said, hopefully the mods, and the readership, will be able to defuse the situation without it escalating out of proportion. \n\n\n**Remember**: The perpetrator here INTENDS ON LEAVING. He's made that clear. Whether he does or not, is an odd question subject to historical precedent, but that's another story. That point is we would all be well served to by ignoring whatever this excise proves to be. You've all seen [the video presumably](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8aqysd/discussion_itwe4kzs_video_about_current_jailbreak/), and unless you've been living under a rock, it's been impossible to avoid the absurd failure perpetrated on Friday and the subsequent fallout. As fun or depressing as it all may be, the question remains\u2026\n\n\nDo we really want to tolerate *more* of it?  And no, advanced warning isn't fueling drama, it's about preparedness. Get ready.",

As in, 'gee this would have gone so much better if it weren't for that little disclosure'.\n\n\nWrong.\n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, **you were found  out *immediately*.** It was within minutes of the initial tweet. It was so obvious, that the *very moment* [a user made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8ag4h6/news_i_hope_you_guys_are_happy/) IT WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY [DEBUNKED](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8ag3st/news_see_what_ungrateful_people_does_to_other/), laughed at, and dismissed. There was fucking **zero reaction**, because none of you were very clever about disguising your intentions leading up to the whole affair.\n\n\n\nThe whole idea was so absurd that when the full roster of the cabal was revealed, we were all more like, 'of course those people were involved, good fucking riddance!'\n\n\nThis is also not your first apology post you've had to make here, and it's a shame you got nominated for damage control. Thanks for your thoughts, but it would have been wiser never to never have gotten involved in the first place.",

  "content": "**NoName Public Repository**  (I just don't have a name yet xD You can post down below nice names probably I will choose a nice one)\n\n\n**Note:** *I'm a first-year student so don't expect an ETA to be fast!*\n\n\nThis repository will be an opportunity for everyone to host/submit their packages on. This repo is going to be developed so it is as user-friendly as it could possibly be with some amazing features. And fully secure as well ;)\n\nYou might not know me because I have not been actively posting on this subreddit, but I have been reading and experiencing a lot on this subreddit. And I think this Reddit needs a main place where developers can easily submit their packages, no matter if it's a paid or free tweak.\n\n\nDown below are some features I'm wanting to implement for the first release:\n\n*For regular users:*\n\n* Login opportunity that will AUTOMATICALLY link your device (Up to 3 devices) with your account upon login.\n* Easily manage your account and the linked devices.\n* User-friendly description pages.\n* Submit reviews and feedback for a package.\n* See the reviews and feedback directly from the package's description page.\n* A safe and secure payment system for paid packages, I think PayPal. (No Patreon features)\n\n*For developers:*\n\n* A nice package management system, easy to submit, update, edit and remove your packages.\n* An easy way to see the feedback for the packages you developed.\n* A safe download system so your paid packages will not be downloaded when the user hasn't purchased the package.\n* A safe and easy gifting system to give away your own packages.\n* An announcement system when opening the package's page you installed or bought. \n* (And eventually an email list system for developers to announce important information to users that bought their packages)\n\n(For me) the features above need to be done for a first release.\n\nFeatures that will eventually be added in future releases:\n* I have some in mind but will update later on this.\n* **Be creative! Let me know what features you guys want in the repository.** \n\nWhile developing this repository I'm really going to try and listen to the community what they actually want and not me. Also let me actually know your opinion about this repository, if it is needed or useless vice versa. For me, this is just a big project, nothing essential. But it could be nice if this can actually mean something for the community.\n\nI also need some help with UI design so if you are in for a little project and don't want anything for it HMU;\n\n\nFor updates, you can follow me on twitter: [@Benaancodz](https://twitter.com/benaancodz). Feel free to ask me some questions or submit ideas there.",

  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nMaybe you already know me, because I am posting lot of bullshit to reddit, but now I want to be serious. Did you notice, that jailbreak community is slowly losing developers, old tweaks are not updated and new tweaks are not created as fast as they should? Why is this happening?\n\nAnswer is simple! Developers don't have enough jailbroken devices and even if they have, it is not possible for them to keep tweaks compatible with latest versions of iOS. But how we can solve it?\n\nThis is also simple (and hard at the same time). We NEED to make fully functional iOS emulator! Yes, this emulator will not be fast and it will be unusable for gaming, because if we managed to emulate iDevices GPUs, we will not be able to use some kind of hardware accelaration, BUT this emulators will be absolutely amazing for jailbreak comunity. Just imagine if every developer can test his tweaks on any version of iOS and without being scared of losing his JB. But is it even possible?\n\nProbably yes. There was already some projects focused on emulating iOS. Only problem we can face now is that we don't have decrypted iBoot (maybe leaked source of iOS 9 iboot?), but if we start working at it we can do it.\n\nSome links:\nhttps://github.com/winocm/QEMU-s5l89xx-port\nhttps://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/IEmu",

As a mobile game developer and part time jailbreak developer (mainly develop for personal use although I've sold several paid and free tweaks on cydia which is why I don't get why people tell me \"you don't even have a paid tweak or develop\" when arguing with me on here as I do and I know the piracy rate is around 98%), I would never join a team with this much negative PR surrounding it. For example, if I got offered a job around a negative franchise *cough cough* Star Wars mobile *cough cough* I wouldn't take it unless it was a completely new iteration of the game. That way any changes I can make will be more effective at creating a new name in a positive way rather than attempting to restore a destroyed game. At this point killing creatix and restarting under a new name with a new team is the only way to not negatively effect the new developers PR.",

Back when I was jailbroken on my iPhone 7 (10.1.1) and then my iPhone X (11.1.2), I used Mikoto on the 7 and then iCleaner on the X to disable OTA updates.  I first noticed on my 7 when I got rid of my jailbreak it that I was unable to update OTA.  Similarly, I was unable to download beta profiles because the phone couldn't find them, in both cases it would just continue to spin endlessly on \"Checking for Update.\"  Now that it's happening on my X, I'm curious to know if this could be related to previously having Mikoto/iCleaner, as both phones have been restored from backups that were jailbroken at some point.   Probably a shot in the dark, but I figured I'd see if anyone else has experienced/come up with a solution.",
