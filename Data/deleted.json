I think something has happened to the stabilisation since it makes a rapid click sound and shakes around, if I look at the camera I can see it physically shaking inside the lens. Any software fixes or is it a hardware problem? I would normally think it\u2019s hardware but since it happened right after I jailbroke I don\u2019t know. Thanks",

  "content": "Hey Guys,\n\nA bit about myself first...\nI am an iPhone user for over 5 years now. Joined the team back in iOS 6 days. Have Jailbroken all my devices and firmware before. The last one being 9.3.3 Pangu on my 5s. I lost my 5s and my Jailbreak with it. Now I am on iPhone 7 on 10.3.2 waiting for Meridian. Hope that it comes out soon.\n\nOkay, back to the discussion now...\n\nThe fact is that it's April, iOS 12 is on the horizon and iOS 10 is already outdated. All the AR Apps, Fortnite and bunch of other Apps are not supported by iOS 10 despite of having a very capable hardware (iPhone 7 in my case). The Jailbreak even if it arrives in due time, iOS 12 will be here and probably even more apps and features will be unsupported by then. My patience for a Jailbreak has started to run out (by no means any way to nag PsycoTea whatsoever). \n\nSecondly, the native iOS is just so stale and has been for so long that it's just too boring to use. I thought about updating to iOS 11.3 (recent at the time of writing) but iOS 11 overall has been a mess and I am just wary to update.\n\nI guess what I am trying to ask is that I have an option to switch to pixel 2 and move to android. I've been hearing good things about Android O on Pixel. And honestly, Android O on Pixel seems so much appealing and I am very tempted to switch over for good. But I wanted to know what do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR\niOS (jailed) is boring, Jailbreaks takes forever and iOS 10 is already missing out on many features and apps. I have an option to switch to Pixel 2 and I wanted to know what do you guys think?\n",

As in the chat linked at the top of this post it shows that Quoll is plotting the now infamous copy and paste tweet, then immediately proceeding to immediately counter that whole thing by showing that he's a bit of a scummy bastard and that this is all just for about a week.\n\nWhile this is all well and good, they then proceed to basically talk shit about the user who dared to ask for a refund for a buggy tweak that didn't work properly, because you know, they already have your money so why should you get it back for something that doesn't work. They do this by calling him entitled of all things as you can see.\n\nThe devs are entitled to a break every now and again, no questions asked there, however disguising this all up as a walkout and that they're never going to come back is incredibly deceptive, and quite frankly, kind of disgusting.

  "content": "For the past 2 years, r/jailbreak has been told over and over again how toxic we are. \u2018Twitter is better, theres a lot less toxicity on there\u2019 \n\nI actually believe this is just because reddit and twitter have a completely different purpose.\n\nWhen it was announced a lot of devs (LaugingQuoll, Andy, Coolstar, Antique_dev, and a few others) were supposedly going to quit, reddit was happy instead of begging them to come back. This is not what they expected. Their plan backfired **completely**. \n\nWhen the conversation showing them plotting the drama was leaked, developers responded, most **not apologizing**, but instead blaming reddit. \n\nQuote from one of the developers who plotted the drama: \u201c\n\nI didn\u2019t intend to start drama however so it may look. I feel that on the community side that is all it\u2019s achieved. So I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\nI learnt a lot from the strike and I saw the most genuine r/jailbreak I ever had.\n\nIt helped in my decision as to my future actions.\u201d\n\nSo after all this, WE, This reddit community is blamed for the drama they plotted, and backfired.\n\n\nBut why? Is reddit really /that/ toxic? Could it be that r/jailbreak is a dedicated jailbreak media; while twitter is not at all?\n\nr/jailbreak is purely dedicated to what is going on in the jailbreak scene. People on here are almost always up to date on the latest tweaks, vulnerabilities, tools, but also on the latest drama.\n\nBecause people decided to come to r/jailbreak, this means they care enough to browse dedicated jailbreak news, which means they are a lot more involved in what\u2019s going on than Twitter. \n\nTwitter is also a place where people follow you if they like you and are interested in your projects. Here on r/jailbreak everyone, the entire community sees your posts. This naturally means that people who do not appreciate you posts see them here as well as reply to it, when on Twitter they wouldn\u2019t. \n\nReddit is generally a place for the more advanced users who mostly understand English properly, whereas twitter has a very large amount of weneta kids who have no idea about the drama going on in the jailbreak world.\n\n\nI actually believe r/jailbreak is the most representative of the entire jailbreak community. \n\nEveryone,  not just the people who follow you and thus are positively bias for you, see your posts, and are free to reply to it. Everyone here can have a public discussion, where posts are easy to find, were on Twitter the replies and such get lost easily. \n\n\nYes, sometimes developers are called out, which should definitely be allowed (as showed the results of the posts too) but in my opinion calling out developers on their shit can actually eventually lead to a positive change, if the developers are able to respond in an decent, grown up way. \n\nAnd unfortunately, that is what certain developers (also the leaders purposefully created drama situation) are just not able to do.\n\nThere is a hand full of developers who by themselves are already known for their drama plays for a long time, that are simply unable to properly respond to customer complaints. \n\nIf these developers would just act like grown ups, 70% of the drama on this sub would disappear **overnight**. \n\n\n**Tl;dr**: \n\nTwitter is a bubble where mostly people who follow you and thus like you respond to you, making you believe the everyone adores you.\n\nr/jailbreak is the real community, where everyone sees your posts and are thus judged by the whole community, not just people who follow you.\n\n\nDevelopers: stop living with the idea that reddit is so toxic. If you receive a lot of toxic messages, there must be a reason for it. Go figure out that reason and change it rather than blaming everyone else. ",

Any advice for another tweak similar to what I\u2019m asking would be greatly appreciated. And btw, I have an iPad Pro 10.5 and a 6S+ both on 11.1.1 and 7+ that I unfortunately got it with 11.2.2... If there\u2019s anything I can do to contribute in making/updating those tweaks, I\u2019d be glad to help.

So to say the least when you are on your way to becoming a Dev whom is reputable and is doing a fantastic job you \"Cannot\" just quit and say \"No More JB for me!\" because you have haters, Boohoo, Man up.  Pro Athletes don't stop running the ball or making plays just because a few fans don't respect them or consider their game weak,  NO! You roll with the punches and keep pushing and that's what displays your true character.  I mean, did you quit developing when you couldn't get your first while loop to work, no!  You kept pushing and you got better.  Point is not being succumbed by the hype makes you the bigger and better person, you don't play games with people and run away from real life scenarios, you take em head on or brush it off and charge it to the game...

  "content": "Last weekend, Packix was deemed insecure because of the fact that anyone was able to pass themselves off as the owner of the service.\n\nAs an admin, the user would be able to upload packages and modify existing packages. But what was overlooked is the ability as a normal user to generate unclaimed coupon codes for any package (paid or free) that you wanted.\n\nIf you're a developer focusing on selling or marketing your tweak or creation, you should probably steer clear of Packix even if it seems like a good place to start.\n\nThis requires little effort to do and codes can be mass-generated for free by any user. This is a gleaming issue for those depending on Packix as a sort of middleman for payments, etc.\n\nThe issue is, developers who use Packix as a platform for distribution can be easily robbed of their work in plain sight.\n\n(Here)[https://ghostbin.com/paste/93v69] is a proof of concept. All you need to know is the package's ID and it's yours.\n\nI intentionally left out package IDs for certain developers. If you like the tweak and want to support the developer, *please* - buy it! I just recommend not using Packix to go about doing so.",

Since it had AppleCare+ on it, I decided to take it to the apple store to see if it was something they could just cover instead since it would still be an alright deal if I had to pay the $99 deductible to replace it and still have one accidental repair left. Luckily they pretty much gave me a new one no questions asked. \nMy last one was on 11.3, but this one is still on 11.1.1. I\u2019m wanting to jailbreak it, I just don\u2019t know if I should leave it where it\u2019s at or update it. I haven\u2019t jailbroken a phone since my iPhone 4 so I\u2019m pretty out of the loop at this point. \n\nTLDR; old phone on 11.3 got replaced by apple with one on 11.1.1.

Some of them stuck even in non-jailbreak mode, which showed it was just 11.1.2 being buggy.\n\nWhile I was still on the Electra beta which may have been part of the problems with what I was having, I couldn\u2019t go to the full version of Electra as there were a few apps that blocked it without fixes as well.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ll keep an eye out on 11.3 jailbreak, but I won\u2019t miss it for now as 11.3 has a MASSIVE speed boost on the iPad Pro 10.5, which to me, isn\u2019t worth a jailbreak right now. Everything\u2019s so fluid and has no hitching with animations, feels like I\u2019m on iOS 10 on here again.\n\nMainly just wanted to let you know, if your device feels lacking on speed, 11.3 does help a ton. While some on here won\u2019t go without a jailbreak at all, there are a few that will value speed (and less bugginess overall) over features.",

That night I upgraded the 64GB model to 11.2.6 and was going to do the 256GB model in the morning. AND THE SIGNING WINDOW CLOSED. GRRR...\n\nOh well. Then Apple announces the iPhone 8 RED. It just arrived. I just checked, 11.2.6. Oh man, that's GREAT.\n\nI have a solid 6S+ jailbroken and I have a paid dev account so it's tether free too. I will just wait for Saurik's JB. Not impressed still seeing all the ongoing complaints about Electra. \n\nBTW, I am keeping the X for dedicated video work. It's staying on 11.1.2 for now. ",

  "content": "I'll share a story along with this. Bought the X about 4 weeks after release. Hated it and grew to hate it even more. Face ID is crap. And I don't need 6 million fn gestures wearing my thumbs out.\nSo 2 weeks ago I get an iPhone 8 64GB. Loved it. Sick of huge phones. Needed more than 64GB though, so bought the 256GB model. That night I upgraded the 64GB model to 11.2.6 and was going to do the 256GB model in the morning. AND THE SIGNING WINDOW CLOSED. GRRR...\nOh well. Then Apple announces the iPhone 8 RED. It just arrived. I just checked, 11.2.6. Oh man, that's GREAT.\nI have a solid 6S+ jailbroken and I have a paid dev account so it's tether free too. I will just wait for Saurik's JB. Not impressed still seeing all the ongoing complaints about Electra.\nBTW, I am keeping the X for dedicated video work. It's staying on 11.1.2 for now. Returned the 64GB i8 and returning the 256GB i8 tomorrow. Keeping the red 256GB.",

Maybe also an updated snapchat++ app, since the current version of snapchat++ that I have downloaded is out of service because the version is old.

  "content": "Hello r/jailbreak community,\n\nLast week I released a beta version (v0.1) of my tweak Active Display to Cydia. It was a dry release intended to iron out bugs. Thanks to a lot of helpful feedback, I've been able to fix lots of issues and improve the tweak quite a bit. Now, I'm pleased to announce that version 1.0 of Active Display has been submitted to BigBoss and will be available soon! \n\nThis tweak is an add-on that lives above the lockscreen. It provides an OLED-friendly interface to quickly glance at the time, see your battery status, and see the number of notifications you have. Simply tap the screen to dismiss it. Also includes charge animation. Tested on iPhone X 11.1.2. Compatible with FastUnlockX.\n\nConfigure options from Settings.\n\n[Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/G6gTl)\n\nChanges:\n\n* added support for 24 hour time\n* fixed issue where hour label would take up two lines\n* fixed cases where AM/PM label would disappear\n\nI've also heard a lot of requests from the community to make this tweak compatible with Dots - I'm going to work on this and see what I can do. In addition, people have been asking for an always-on display mode for this tweak. I'm considering adding this in a later release (with burn-in protection) if I can find a battery-friendly way to make it work.\n\nThanks to everyone who has emailed me with Cydia bug reports and screenshots. Please continue to send in bug reports for any issues you find - these really help me make the tweak better. Let me know what you guys think about Active Display!",
